# terraform-aws-mongodbatlas
Terraform module which creates a MongoDB Atlas cluster on AWS

These types of resources are supported:
* [Project](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/mongodbatlas/r/project.html)
* [Cluster](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/mongodbatlas/r/cluster.html)
* [Teams](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/mongodbatlas/r/team.html)
* [Whitelists](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/mongodbatlas/r/project_ip_whitelist.html)
* [Network Peering](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/mongodbatlas/r/network_peering.html)

## Terraform versions

Terraform versions >=0.12 are supported
   
## Usage

```hcl
module "atlas_cluster" {
  source = ".//terraform-aws-mongodbatlas"

  project_name = "my-project"
  org_id = "5edf67f9b9b528996228111"

  teams = {
    Devops: {
      users: ["example@mail.io", "user@mail.io"]
      role: "GROUP_OWNER"
    },
    DevTeam: {
      users: ["developer@mail.io",]
      role: "GROUP_READ_ONLY"
    }
  }

  white_lists = {
    "example comment": "10.0.0.1/32",
    "second example": "10.10.10.8/32"
  }

  region = "EU_WEST_1"

  cluster_name = "MyCluster"

  instance_type = "M30"
  mongodb_major_ver = 4.2
  cluster_type = "REPLICASET"
  num_shards = 1
  replication_factor = 3
  provider_backup = true
  pit_enabled = false

}
```
## Prerequisites
* [MongoDB Cloud account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud)
* [MongoDB Atlas Organization](https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2#/preferences/organizations/create)
* [MongoDB Atlas API key](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/mongodbatlas/index.html)

#### Manual tasks:

* Configure the API key before applying the module
* Get your MongoDB Atlas Organization ID from the UI

#### Create Teams:
In case you want to create Teams and associate them with the project, users must be added in advance and making sure they have accepted the invitation.
Users who have not accepted an invitation to join the organization cannot be added as team members. 

## VPC Peering
In case vpc peering is required, AWS provider will be used, the following information is required:
* [Access to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
* VPC ID
* [AWS account ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html)
* Region
* [Routable cidr block](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/mongodbatlas/r/network_peering.html#route_table_cidr_block)

You can add them manually, or through other Terraform resources, and pass it to the module via ```vpc_peer``` variable:
```hcl
  vpc_peer = {
    vpc_peer1 : {
      aws_account_id : "020201234877"
      region : "eu-west-1"
      vpc_id : "vpc-0240c8a47312svc3e"
      route_table_cidr_block : "172.16.0.0/16"
    }
```

You can see this [example](https://github.com/guyelia/terraform-aws-mongodbatlas/blob/master/examples/basic/main.tf) in the examples folder.
